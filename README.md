# osgoodspace
A fully functional open-source conversational AI built with Python machine learning, Google APIs, and Python Flask for web integration.

### Who is osgood?
Charles E Osgood dedicated his life to psychology, yet received little recognition for his work. Thus, we decided it was only right to contribute this project in his name; a project that revolves around a potential avenue for virtual therapy. A virtual friend that anyone can talk to anytime they want.

Where can I demo this HackerTX project?
Go to main.ipynb to try the program out, requires you recording a .wav file audio and running the interpreter function on it. After that, the pipeline is chronological and thus pretty straightforward: run the response program, and then turn that text file into audio file for seamless audio response.

## Important
Please ask me for the service authentication in person if you plan on running this with my google cloud account, otherwise you can create your own google cloud account for free and enable the texttospeech, speech, and dialogflow APIs, then generate your own token for independent running of this program.
